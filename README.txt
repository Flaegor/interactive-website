questions for tutorial:
xDONE how to resize white gradient to match heroimage (fixed put in container + height 100% no max)

- FIX KNOWN: how to fix responsiveness of heroimage (change 1200px to 900px @1200px query) (make sure everything at least has a parent with a constrained width) if width is 100% + margin, width will exceed 100%

xDONE how to fix heroimage going infront of header, turning off relative position of .imageparent/.imagechild works (fixed z index)

xDONE why is burgernav not working? (Max-device-width vs max width, look at burger nav for good example now, and replicate on other queries)

xDONE when using section jump links, how to get them to place the screen better (add padding to sections as links are jumping to the section ID)

xDONE .gridhero center not working, something to do with text-center on h1? (issue: wrapper was 1200px, p was 900px cascading)

xDONE .gridhero not abiding 1200px width (issue gridhero.wrapper = gridhero .wrapper. WHY is space inconsistent)

- responsiveness at 1200px causes everything to stop centering

- herointro text isn't centering in 1200px mediaquery
